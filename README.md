PIOT-Java-Components

PIOT-Java-Components is a modular Java framework designed to support device-to-cloud IoT communication, configuration management, and data exchange.
It serves as a foundation for building scalable IoT systems and demonstrates strong object-oriented design, multi-protocol communication (MQTT, CoAP), and cloud integration concepts.

Overview

This project showcases the core building blocks of an IoT ecosystem — including device clients, gateway controllers, configuration modules, and testing scaffolds — implemented in Java.
Developed as part of the Programming the Internet of Things (PIoT) coursework, the repository focuses on modularity, reusability, and extensibility, following clean coding and software design principles.

Key Highlights

Device–Gateway–Cloud Architecture: Implements layered IoT communication between local devices and cloud endpoints.

Protocol Support:

MQTT for lightweight publish–subscribe messaging (via Eclipse Paho).

CoAP for constrained application protocol testing (via Eclipse Californium).

AWS IoT SDK Integration: Demonstrates secure, TLS-based connectivity between devices and cloud services.

Data Serialization: Uses Google Gson for structured data exchange between components.

Configuration Management: Dynamic loading of device and gateway configuration files using Apache Commons Configuration.

Test-Driven Development: Includes JUnit test skeletons organized by module (Part 1–4) to validate functionality.

Build Automation: Managed using Apache Maven for dependency resolution and modular builds.
